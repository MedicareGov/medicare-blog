Have you had your mammogram this year? Mammograms are breast cancer screening tests that can often detect a lump before you or your doctor can feel it. This can help detect breast cancer early, when it's the most treatable. All women over 40 should have a screening mammogram every 12 months - and [Medicare covers it for free](http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/breast-cancer-screening.aspx) if your doctor accepts assignment. 

Talk to your doctor about risk factors, and to schedule your next screening.Â  Ask your family members and friends if they've had theirs - share the health.
