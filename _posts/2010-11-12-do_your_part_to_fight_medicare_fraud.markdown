Fraud costs taxpayers like you millions of dollars every year, and we all end up paying for it with higher health care costs. The new health care law, the Affordable Care Act, provides better ways to prevent fraud and protect you – the people who rely on Medicare the most. You can read about some of those new tools on [healthcare.gov](http://www.healthcare.gov/news/factsheets/index.html).

HHS and the Department of Justice are also working together on a new Cabinet-level Fraud Fighting Initiative called [HEAT](http://stopmedicarefraud.gov/heattaskforce/index.html) which has helped returns millions to the Medicare Trust Fund.

Medicare is working hard to crack down on criminals who steal from Medicare but oftentimes scam artists go after people with Medicare directly. As you review your coverage choices during this fall’s Open Enrollment period, there are some simple things that you can do to help prevent Medicare fraud:



	
  * No one should call you or come to your home uninvited to get you to join a Medicare plan. Don’t give your personal information to someone who does this.

	
  * Your Medicare number is personal information, just like a credit card number. Keep it safe so that no one can pretend to be you.

	
  * Medicare plans can’t ask you for credit card or banking information over the telephone or email, unless you’re already a member of that plan.

	
  * Medicare plans can’t enroll you into a plan over the telephone unless you call them and ask to enroll.


Always check your medical bills, Medicare Summary Notices, and Explanation of Benefits to make sure you’re not being charged for a service or piece of equipment you didn’t get. You can also check your Original Medicare claims on MyMedicare.gov or the 1-800-MEDICARE automated phone system.
