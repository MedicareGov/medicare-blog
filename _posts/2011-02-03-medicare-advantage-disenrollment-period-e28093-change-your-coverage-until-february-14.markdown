We all know what it’s like to have second thoughts about a decision… especially when it comes to health care, when the choices you make can have a big impact on you and your family.

If you chose a Medicare Advantage Plan that turned out not to be a good fit for you, this is your chance to change it. The Medicare Advantage Disenrollment Period runs until February 14, 2011, and if you have a Medicare Advantage Plan that isn’t working for you, you can use this period to switch back to Original Medicare.

There are two ways to switch from your Medicare Advantage Plan to Original Medicare:  you can contact your Medicare Advantage Plan and disenroll that way.  Or, if your Medicare Advantage Plan included drug coverage, you can simply choose and join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan. You’ll automatically be disenrolled from your Medicare Advantage Plan, and your health coverage will switch to Original Medicare.

Whichever way you disenroll, your Original Medicare coverage and any Medicare drug coverage you choose at this time will start the first day of the month after you disenroll. If you switch to Original Medicare and your Medicare Advantage Plan included drug coverage, you have until February 14 to also join a Medicare Prescription Drug Plan.

You can only make limited changes during the Disenrollment Period. This isn’t a time to switch from Original Medicare to a Medicare Advantage Plan; switch from one Medicare Advantage Plan to another; switch from one Medicare Prescription Drug Plan to another; or join, switch, or drop a Medicare Medical Savings Account Plan.

If you have questions about choosing coverage, you can review your [Medicare Coverage Choices](https://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/coverage-choices.aspx) to help decide which coverage is right for you, or get information about [Medicare Coverage Basics](https://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medicare-benefits/medicare-benefits-overview.aspx). If you still have questions, you can get free personalized help by calling your State Health Insurance Assistance Program.
