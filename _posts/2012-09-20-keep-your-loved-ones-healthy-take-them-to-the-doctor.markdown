Who doesn’t want another reason to celebrate? This year add a new holiday to your family’s calendar – Take Your Loved One to the Doctor Day on September 20th. After all, what’s a better reason to celebrate than the good health of the people you love?

The best way to stay healthy is to live a healthy lifestyle. Your loved one can live a healthy lifestyle and prevent disease by exercising, eating well, keeping a healthy weight, not smoking, and taking advantage of Medicare’s [preventive services](http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html). 

Preventive services can find health problems early, when treatment works best, and can keep your loved one from getting certain diseases. The first [“Welcome to Medicare” preventive visit](http://www.medicare.gov/people-like-me/new-to-medicare/welcome-to-medicare-visit.html) and [yearly “Wellness” visit](http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html) are a key part of a healthy lifestyle.  

Schedule a doctor’s appointment today, and as long as the doctor accepts [assignment](http://www.medicare.gov/Glossary/a.html#assignment) there’s no cost. Now that’s something to celebrate!
