We hope every healthcare experience you have is a positive one. That’s why we offer you a variety of tools to express your concerns. One of those tools is the ability to file a complaint (sometimes called a “grievance”).

**Do you have a complaint?**

If you have a concern or a problem that isn’t a request for coverage or reimbursement, you have the right to file a complaint. Not sure if you need to [file a complaint or an appeal](http://www.medicare.gov/claims-and-appeals/index.html)? Read some [examples of situations](http://www.medicare.gov/claims-and-appeals/file-a-complaint/complaints.html) where you might need to file a complaint.

**Things to know before you file a complaint:**

Each plan has specific rules you’ll need to know and follow when filing a complaint.  If, after filing a complaint, your plan doesn’t address the issue, call 1-800-MEDICARE for assistance. You can also call your [State Health Insurance Assistance Program (SHIP)](https://medicare.gov/Contacts/Default.aspx) for free, personalized help filing a complaint.

**Information you’ll need to have ready when you file a complaint:**** **

**Basic information about you **



	
  * First and last name

	
  * Date of birth

	
  * State you live in

	
  * Zip code

	
  * Email address

	
  * Preferred call back time, phone number, and response language


**Medicare card information **



	
  * Medicare number

	
  * Effective date


**Health or drug plan information**



	
  * Your health or drug plan name

	
  * Your health or drug plan contract ID


**Complaint topic**

**2 tools Medicare offers that can help…**

1. A [Personal Health Record](http://www.medicare.gov/manage-your-health/personal-health-records/personal-health-records.html) (PHR) is a record with information about your health that you, or someone helping you, can keep for easy reference using a computer. You control the health information in your PHR and can get to it anywhere, at any time, with Internet access.

2. The [Blue Button](http://www.medicare.gov/manage-your-health/blue-button/medicare-blue-button.html) tool provides you an easy way to download your personal health information to a file. You can download the file of your personal data and save the file on your own personal computer.  You can access the Blue Button through your account on [MyMedicare.gov](https://www.mymedicare.gov/).
