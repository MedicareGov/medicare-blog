This year include tobacco in your annual spring cleaning, and kick those cigarette butts in the, well, butt!  Why? Because tobacco use is the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 1 in every 10 adult deaths. If you or someone you love is ready to quit smoking, we can help.

**Medicare can help you quit smoking**

Part B covers free counseling sessions as a preventive service to help you [quit smoking](http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx). If you haven't been diagnosed with an illness caused or complicated by tobacco use, and if the doctor or other health care provider accepts assignment, then you pay nothing for the counseling sessions.

If you’ve already been diagnosed with an illness that was caused or made worse by tobacco use, or you take a medicine affected by tobacco, you can still get up to 8 counseling sessions every 12 months. In this case, you pay your Part B deductible and 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. (If you get counseling in a hospital outpatient setting, you’ll also need to pay the hospital a copayment.)

**Let’s get started!**

Bring out the trash bags and the brooms – it’s time for a clean start this spring. Visit the [Centers for Disease Control](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/) and the [National Cancer Institute](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/tobacco/smoking) to learn more about how you can quit smoking.
