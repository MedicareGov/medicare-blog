Are you or a loved one hooked on tobacco? Join the millions who’ve found a good reason to give it up—tobacco use is the second leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for 1 in every 10 adult deaths.

If you’re ready to quit, we can help. Part B covers free counseling sessions as a preventive service to help you [quit smoking](http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx)—you pay nothing if your doctor accepts Medicare’s payment.

If you’ve already been diagnosed with an illness caused or made worse by tobacco use or you take a medicine affected by tobacco, you can continue to get up to 8 face-to-face counseling visits every 12 months. You pay your Part B deductible, and 20% of the Medicare-approved amount. If you get counseling in a hospital outpatient setting, you also pay the hospital a copayment.

Make May 31—World “No Tobacco” Day—your starting point to kick the habit. Visit the [Centers for Disease Control](http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/) and the [National Cancer Institute](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/tobacco/smoking) to learn more about tobacco use and how you can overcome it.

Also, watch our [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r52w97yTsuE&list=UUhHTRPxz8awulGaTMh3SAkA&index=6&feature=plcp) about the World Health Organization’s World No Tobacco Day campaign and how Medicare supports it.
