Every year, more people die from lung cancer than any other type of cancer and smoking is the leading cause. Don’t become a statistic - Medicare is ready to help you quit smoking. Talk to your doctor today and cross one thing off your list.

Besides being famous for Thanksgiving, November is also Lung Cancer Awareness Month. While you’re making lists for the upcoming holiday season, make a note to talk with your doctor about quitting if you smoke. Medicare covers 8 face-to-face [smoking cessation ](http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx)counseling sessions during a 12-month period. If you haven't been diagnosed with an illness caused or complicated by tobacco use, you pay nothing for these counseling sessions, as long as you get them from a qualified doctor or another Medicare provider.
