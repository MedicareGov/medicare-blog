Many people could be saving money on premiums and prescriptions, and don’t even know it. Recently, a 90-year-old woman in Oklahoma came to her local State Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance Program (SHIP) because she was unable to pay for her prescriptions and her Medicare Part D premium.

A counselor at the SHIP helped her apply for Extra Help and found her a new Part D plan that better fit her needs. Now she spends no money on her premium and very little on her prescriptions – saving her thousands of dollars over the course of the year. She is just one of many people that can save money – and you could be one too.

**Medicare Savings Programs**

If your monthly income is less than $1,277 ($1,723 as a couple), you may be able to save money with these 4 different Medicare Savings Programs that help pay for premiums and more:



	
  * Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) Program

	
  * Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB)

	
  * Qualified Individual (QI) Program

	
  * Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI)


Each program has a different monthly income limit – [get more information about the 2012 limits](http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx) and how to find out if you qualify.

**Extra Help**

Many people with limited income and resources may qualify for [Medicare’s “Extra Help” program](http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx), but they must apply to find out. You could be one of them. You may qualify if you have up to $16,755 in yearly income ($22,695 for a married couple) and up to $13,070 in resources ($26,120 for a married couple). [Get more information about Medicare’s “Extra Help” program](http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx#LowIncomeSubsidy).

You can get help with Part D prescription drug coverage premiums, deductibles and copayments. This means you don’t have to go without medications because you can’t afford them, and can get help just like our 90-year-old friend in Oklahoma.

Save money, live well, and share the information.
