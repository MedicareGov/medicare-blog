Have you ever been tested for Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)? More than 1 million Americans are infected with HIV, yet approximately 1 in 5 of them don't know it.

Medicare covers [HIV screening](http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/hiv-screening.html) for people with Medicare of any age who ask for the test, pregnant women, and people at increased risk for the infection (such as gay and bisexual men, injection drug users, or people with multiple sexual partners).

Early testing and diagnosis play key roles in reducing the spread of the disease, extending life expectancy, and cutting costs of care. At least 1 in 3 people in the U.S. who test positive for HIV is tested too late to get the full advantage of treatment. Testing is also an important first step in getting HIV-infected people the medical care and support they need to improve their health and help them maintain safer behaviors.

Visit Health & Human Servicesâ€™ [Aids.gov](http://aids.gov/) website to learn about [National HIV Testing Day](http://aids.gov/news-and-events/awareness-days/hiv-testing-day/), June 27.
