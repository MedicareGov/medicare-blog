Talk to your doctor to find out when you should get your free screening test.

If you have diabetes, [Medicare covers many of your supplies](http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-supplies-and-services.html), including test strips, monitors, and control solutions.

Medicare also covers [diabetes self-management training](http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/diabetes-self-mgmt-training.html) to help you learn how to better manage your diabetes.
