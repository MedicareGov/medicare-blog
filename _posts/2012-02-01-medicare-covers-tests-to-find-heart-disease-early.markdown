Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, so it’s important to take care of your heart to stay healthy. Start now, during American Heart Month, by talking to your doctor about whether you’re at risk for heart disease and to schedule your free [cardiovascular screening](http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/cardiovascular-screening.aspx). Medicare covers these tests, which help detect heart disease early and check your cholesterol, blood fat (lipid), and triglyceride levels.

 Medicare will cover a cardiovascular screening at no cost to you every 5 years, so be sure to schedule your screening to get the most out of your Medicare.

 If your doctor thinks you’re at risk for a heart attack or stroke, there are steps you can take to help prevent these conditions, such as take medication. Your doctor may also suggest you make the following lifestyle changes to lower your cholesterol and stay healthy:



	
  *          Change your diet

	
  *          Increase your activity level

	
  *          Exercise more often


Making lifestyle changes can be challenging, but you don’t have to reach your heart health goals alone. Join [Million Hearts](http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/), a national campaign to help prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes over the next 5 years. Join now to get the information and resources you need to learn how to take care of your heart and live a healthy life.
