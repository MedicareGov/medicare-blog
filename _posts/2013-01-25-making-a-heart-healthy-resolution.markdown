It’s the New Year, which means it’s time for those annual resolutions, whether it’s eating right or tackling a new skill.  But none may be more important than making the resolution to get heart healthy in 2013.

Did you know heart attacks and strokes are the first and fourth leading cause of death in the U.S.? The [Million Hearts™ initiative](http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/), launched in 2012, is aiming to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. CMS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working with other federal agencies, communities, health systems, non-profit organizations and private-sector partners to help educate Americans on how to make a long-lasting impact against cardiovascular disease.

If you’re at risk for, or are already suffering from, heart disease, now’s the time to practice the “Million Hearts ABCS”:



	
  * **A**spirin for people at risk

	
  * **B**lood pressure control

	
  * **C**holesterol management and

	
  * **S**moking cessation


Medicare can help you take control of many of the major risk factors for heart disease. People with Medicare can get [cardiovascular screenings](http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html), [counseling to stop smoking](http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/smoking-and-tobacco-use-cessation.html), and blood pressure and weight checks during their [yearly wellness visit](http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html) with their doctor.

Make a New Year’s resolution and give your loved ones one more gift they’ll be sure to treasure—a healthier you in 2013. Help prevent a heart attack or stroke by [joining the Million Hearts](http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/be_one_mh.html)™ initiative.
