Do you know about the “Beneficio Adicional” or “Extra Help” program? My mother always told me if you wanted to know anything, you went to “la plaza del pueblo” (town square).  You went to socialize with neighbors, exchange important news, pass “chisme” (gossip) and take part in the community. The plaza was all about conversation and learning from one another what’s really happening in the world. We may have left the plaza behind, but the tradition of sharing information is as vital as ever. Blogs, IM, chat and social media are now our plaza. So here is some important information you might want to pass on. 

Many people with limited income and resources may qualify for Medicare’s “Extra Help” program, but they must apply to find out. You could be one of them. 

You can get help with Part D prescription drug coverage premiums, deductibles and co-payments. This means you don’t have to go without medications because you can’t afford them. 

It’s easy and free to apply for “Extra Help.”  



	
  * Visit Social Security’s [Web site](http://www.segurosocial.gov/beneficioadicional) (in Spanish or English) to apply online or for more information.

	
  * Call Social Security at 1-800-772-1213 to apply over the phone or request an application (TTY users should call 1-800-325-0778). 

	
  * Apply at your local [Social Security](http://www.segurosocial.gov/) office.


Save money, live well, and share the information, because this program is too important to keep to yourself.
