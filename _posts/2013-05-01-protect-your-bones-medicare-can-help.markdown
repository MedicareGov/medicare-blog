Do you keep putting off exercise? You may be hurting your bones. Lack of exercise is one of the risk factors that can lead to osteoporosis. When people have osteoporosis their bones become less dense. You may not know that you have osteoporosis until your bones are so weak that a sudden strain, bump, or fall causes your wrist to break or your hip to fracture.

Medicare can help you prevent or detect osteoporosis at an early stage, when treatment works best. Talk to your doctor about getting a [bone mass measurement](http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/bone-density.html)—it may be free.

May is National Osteoporosis Awareness and Prevention Month. Learn more about what puts you at risk for osteoporosis and how to prevent or treat it at the [National Osteoporosis Foundation](http://www.nof.org/) or the [Centers for Disease Control](http://www.cdc.gov/nutrition/everyone/basics/vitamins/calcium.html). Watch our short [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=opQFBVd7oHI) to learn more about how Medicare can help you protect your bones.
