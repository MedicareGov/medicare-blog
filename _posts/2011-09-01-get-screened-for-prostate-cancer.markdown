September is Prostate Cancer Awareness Month. Did you know prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men?

Help prevent prostate cancer from affecting you or the men in your life. If you’re 50 or older, make sure you get screened for prostate cancer every 12 months.

[Medicare covers these two tests](http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/prostate-cancer-screening.aspx) to help find prostate cancer early, when treatment works best:



	
  * Digital rectal exam—You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount after the yearly Part B deductible.****

	
  * Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test—Free to all men with Medicare 50 and older (coverage for this test begins the day after your 50th birthday).


You can learn about prostate cancer by visiting the [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostatecancer/index), the [National Cancer Institute](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/prostate), and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/prostate/index.htm).

Early detection matters: get screened every 12 months.
