Medicare Offers Information and Support to Caregivers.

More than 66 million Americans care for loved ones who have a chronic illness, disability, or frailties that come naturally with old age. Nobody is in a better position than family caregivers to help loved ones manage their health care when it comes to medicines, treatments, diets, and exercise.

Looking for assistance and information? We can help. [Ask Medicare ](http://www.medicare.gov/caregivers/)has [tips sheets, videos and practical information for caregivers](http://medicare.gov/caregivers/partners-toolkit-caregivers.html), including tips on [what every caregiver should know ](http://medicare.gov/caregivers/SharedResources/shared/pdf/CMS_CaregiverShouldKnow_6_508.pdf)and [answers to your Medicare questions](http://medicare.gov/caregivers/SharedResources/shared/pdf/CMS_Q A AboutMedicare_6_508.pdf). As a caregiver we know you’re juggling a lot, so we put it all in one place to save you time.
