_By Donald Berwick, M.D., Administrator, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services_

In Medicare’s continued efforts to lower healthcare costs while still providing the care you need, a new program, called the Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics, and Supplies (DMEPOS) Competitive Bidding Program, begins January 1, 2011.

This program will save you money, ensure that you continue to get high quality medical items, and help prevent fraud. All Medicare contract suppliers must be licensed, meet strict quality and financial standards, and be accredited by a national accreditation organization.

**Use Medicare-contract Suppliers**

If you have Original Medicare, live in one of the [affected areas](http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11307.pdf), and use [equipment or supplies included in the program](http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/11307.pdf) (or get the items while visiting one of these areas), you will almost always have to use a Medicare-contract supplier if you want Medicare to help you pay for the items. Making sure your item is covered by Medicare, determining whether you live in one of the affected areas, and making sure your supplier is a Medicare contract supplier are the best ways to ensure you keep getting the same high quality equipment as before. Talk to your doctor, other health care provider, or supplier if you have questions.

**Find Medicare-contract Suppliers**

Visit [the Medicare Supplier Directory](http://www.medicare.gov/Supplier) to find the most up-to-date list of Medicare contract suppliers. The supplier directory contains names, addresses, and contact information for suppliers that provide Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthesis, Orthotics and Supplies services or products under the Medicare Program. If you live in a competitive bidding area, you will need to use suppliers that have an orange star ![](http://www.medicare.gov/Supplier/images/star_icon_orange.gif) beside their names for Medicare to help pay.
