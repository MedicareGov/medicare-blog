Do you care for someone who is terminally ill? It isn’t always easy to care for a loved one in difficult times, but Medicare can help – you don’t have to do it alone. Medicare covers care for people who are terminally ill, and we have [resources to help you](http://www.medicare.gov/caregivers/caregiver-topics-support.html).

[Hospice](http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/02154.pdf) is a program of care and support for people who are terminally ill. The focus is on comfort, or “palliative” care, not on curing an illness. Hospice care can include doctor and nursing services, counseling, medical supplies, pain medications, and other services.

If your doctor has certified that your loved one is terminally ill, Medicare covers hospice care, which is usually provided in the home. Medicare will still pay for covered benefits for any health problems that aren’t related to your loved one’s terminal illness. [Get more details about Medicare’s coverage](http://www.medicare.gov/Coverage/Home.asp).

Remember, you’re not alone – Medicare is here to help. You can also get information about [long-term planning, managing stress, and much more](http://www.medicare.gov/caregivers/).
