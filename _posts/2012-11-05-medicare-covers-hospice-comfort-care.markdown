Do you care for someone who’s terminally ill? It can be hard taking care of everyday activities while trying to care for someone who’s sick. The comforting news is you don’t have to do it alone. Medicare can help.

Medicare covers care for people who are terminally ill, and we have [resources to help you](http://www.medicare.gov/caregivers/caregiver-topics-support.html). As part of [hospice coverage](http://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/part-a/part-a-coverage-hospice.html), your loved one can get the care and support they need. This can include doctor and nursing services, counseling, medical supplies, pain medications, and other services. And, most importantly, hospice can provide much needed comfort while at home.

Remember, you’re not alone – Medicare is here to help. There are resources to help you [plan for the future, take care of yourself, and much more](http://www.medicare.gov/caregivers/).
