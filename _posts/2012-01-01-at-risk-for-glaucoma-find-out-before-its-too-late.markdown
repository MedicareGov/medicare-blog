Do you have diabetes, a family history of glaucoma, or are you African American and age 50 or older? If so, your risk of getting glaucoma may be higher.

You can prevent vision loss by finding and treating problems early.  [Find out more about Medicare’s glaucoma screening coverage.](http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/glaucoma-tests.aspx)
