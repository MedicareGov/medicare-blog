Love your red, white, and blue “Medicare & You” handbook? Did you ever think it would be nice to get the same information online? Knowing that the number of people 65 and over using the web has tripled in the past 10 years, we thought it would be a good idea too. And, now we’ve got some great news! 

As part of the [new Medicare.gov](http://blog.medicare.gov/2012/08/21/the-new-medicare-gov-making-medicare-information-clearer-simpler/http:/blog.medicare.gov/2012/08/21/the-new-medicare-gov-making-medicare-information-clearer-simpler/), you can [go on the web](https://www.medicare.gov/medicare-and-you/medicare-and-you.html) and access all the same information found in your printed handbook. You can learn what’s new for the year, how Medicare works with your other insurance, get Medicare costs, and find out what Medicare covers. Even better, the handbook information on the web is updated regularly, so you can instantly find the most up-to-date Medicare information.

You can also do a lot of things on your own like replace your Medicare card, change your address, sign up or make changes to your Medicare coverage, and find out important date. All this in time for October 15 – the start of open enrollment.
