**Announced on September 13, 2011, Million Hearts is a national initiative to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes over the next 5 years.**








 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services are the co-leaders of Million Hearts within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, working alongside other federal agencies including the National Institutes of Health, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and the Food and Drug Administration. Key private-sector partners include the American Heart Association and YMCA among others.

Heart disease and stroke are two of the leading causes of death in the United States. Million Hearts aims to improve heart disease and stroke prevention by focusing on five pillars of action:



	
  1. [![Graphic: Million Hearts](http://www.cdc.gov/Features/MillionHearts/MillionHearts_255px.jpg)](http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/)Prioritize focus and attention around the ABCS (**A**spirin for people at high risk, **B**lood pressure control, **C**holesterol management, **S**moking cessation)

	
  2. Encourage the meaningful use of health information technology (HIT) to drive improvement

	
  3. Deliver care innovations
