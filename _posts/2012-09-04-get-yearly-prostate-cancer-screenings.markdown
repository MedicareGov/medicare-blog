 Did you know prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men?

Help prevent prostate cancer from affecting you or the men in your life. If you’re a man who’s 50 or older, make sure you get screened for prostate cancer every 12 months. 

[Your Medicare Part B (Medical Insurance) covers 2 tests](http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/prostate-cancer-screenings.html) to help find prostate cancer early, when treatment works best:



	
  * Digital rectal exam—You pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount after the yearly Part B deductible.

	
  * Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test—Free to all men with Medicare 50 and older (coverage for this test begins the day after your 50th birthday).


Also, whether you’re seeking coverage information on prostate cancer screenings or another item, service or test, quickly find [what’s covered](http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/your-medicare-coverage.html) by visiting our [newly redesigned website](http://www.medicare.gov/).

Learn more about prostate cancer by visiting the [American Cancer Society](http://www.cancer.org/cancer/prostatecancer/index), the [National Cancer Institute](http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/types/prostate), and the [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](http://www.cdc.gov/cancer/prostate/index.htm).

Early detection matters: get screened every 12 months.
