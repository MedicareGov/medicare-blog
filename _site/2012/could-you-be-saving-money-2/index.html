          <p>Many people could be saving money on premiums and prescriptions, and don’t even know it. Recently, a 90-year-old woman in Oklahoma came to her local State Health Insurance Counseling and Assistance Program (SHIP) because she was unable to pay for her prescriptions and her Medicare Part D premium.</p>

<p>A counselor at the SHIP helped her apply for Extra Help and found her a new Part D plan that better fit her needs. Now she spends no money on her premium and very little on her prescriptions – saving her thousands of dollars over the course of the year. She is just one of many people that can save money – and you could be one too.</p>

<p><strong>Medicare Savings Programs</strong></p>

<p>If your monthly income is less than $1,277 ($1,723 as a couple), you may be able to save money with these 4 different Medicare Savings Programs that help pay for premiums and more:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Qualified Medicare Beneficiary (QMB) Program</p></li>
<li><p>Specified Low-Income Medicare Beneficiary (SLMB)</p></li>
<li><p>Qualified Individual (QI) Program</p></li>
<li><p>Qualified Disabled and Working Individuals (QDWI)</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Each program has a different monthly income limit – <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx">get more information about the 2012 limits</a> and how to find out if you qualify.</p>

<p><strong>Extra Help</strong></p>

<p>Many people with limited income and resources may qualify for <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx">Medicare’s “Extra Help” program</a>, but they must apply to find out. You could be one of them. You may qualify if you have up to $16,755 in yearly income ($22,695 for a married couple) and up to $13,070 in resources ($26,120 for a married couple). <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/medicare-basics/medical-and-drug-costs.aspx#LowIncomeSubsidy">Get more information about Medicare’s “Extra Help” program</a>.</p>

<p>You can get help with Part D prescription drug coverage premiums, deductibles and copayments. This means you don’t have to go without medications because you can’t afford them, and can get help just like our 90-year-old friend in Oklahoma.</p>

<p>It’s easy and free to <a href="https://secure.ssa.gov/i1020/start">apply for “Extra Help.”</a></p>

<p>Save money, live well, and share the information.</p>
