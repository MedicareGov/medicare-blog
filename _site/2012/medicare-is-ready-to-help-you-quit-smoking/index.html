          <p>Every year, more people die from lung cancer than any other type of cancer and smoking is the leading cause. Don’t become a statistic - Medicare is ready to help you quit smoking. Talk to your doctor today and cross one thing off your list.</p>

<p>Besides being famous for Thanksgiving, November is also Lung Cancer Awareness Month. While you’re making lists for the upcoming holiday season, make a note to talk with your doctor about quitting if you smoke. Medicare covers 8 face-to-face <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/smoking-cessation.aspx">smoking cessation </a>counseling sessions during a 12-month period. If you haven't been diagnosed with an illness caused or complicated by tobacco use, you pay nothing for these counseling sessions, as long as you get them from a qualified doctor or another Medicare provider.</p>
