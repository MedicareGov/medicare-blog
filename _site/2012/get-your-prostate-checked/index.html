          <p>Have you ever put off doing a task or getting a test and later wished you’d just gotten it over with? Now’s the time to talk with your doctor about whether you should <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/prostate-cancer-screening.aspx">get screened for prostate cancer</a>. It’s the most common cancer in men, second only to lung cancer in the number of cancer deaths. The potential benefit of prostate cancer screening is early detection of cancer, which may make treatment more effective.</p>

<p>If you’re a man 50 or over, Medicare covers a digital rectal exam and Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) test once every 12 months. Generally, you pay 20% of the Medicare-approved amount for the digital rectal exam after the yearly Part B deductible. You pay nothing for the PSA test.</p>

<p>Not sure if you should get screened? You’re at a higher risk for getting prostate cancer if you’re a man 50 or older, are African-American, or have a father, brother, or son who has had prostate cancer.</p>

<p>June is Men’s Health Month, a perfect time for you (and the men in your life) to take the steps to live a safer, healthier life.
