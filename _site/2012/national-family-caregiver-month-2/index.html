          <p>More than 66 million Americans care for loved ones who have a chronic illness, disability, or frailties that come naturally with old age. Nobody is in a better position than family caregivers to help loved ones manage their health and health care, like medicines, treatments, diets, and exercise. Only you know what's most important to you and your loved ones - that's why we want to be sure you have all the information you need to make the best decisions.</p>

<p>During Open Enrollment - which ends on December 7th – it’s worth your time to review and compare your loved one's coverage choices. Only you can decide what mix of benefits and costs will work best with your loved one’s needs and budget. Now is the time to look at all of the <a href="https://www.medicare.gov/find-a-plan/questions/home.aspx">health and drug plan options in your area</a>. If you still need help comparing plans, call 1‑800‑MEDICARE. </p>

Our <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/campaigns/caregiver/caregiver.html">caregiver resources</a> have tip sheets, videos, and practical information for caregivers, including tips on what Medicare covers, planning for the future, and taking care of yourself.
