          <p>It’s a whole lot easier to read and understand your <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/glossary/m.html#msn">Medicare Summary Notice</a> (MSN), thanks to a recently completed redesign. You’ll see a brand new format when you check your MSN at <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a> gives you faster access to your Medicare claims information—you can check it 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. Customize your MSN to see procedures broken down by single claim, or by a time period you choose, and print out your own statement anytime. Reviewing your MSN online means a shorter wait to see what you were charged for health care services, medical supplies or equipment, and how much Medicare paid.</p>

<p>We want the MSN to be something that makes it easier for you to find and understand your Medicare claims information.  We spent more than a year improving it. We did one-one-one interviews and focus groups with people like you, and used their feedback to improve the design and language.</p>

<p>As a recent joint <a href="http://www.kaiserhealthnews.org/stories/2012/march/07/medicare-fraud-seniors-bills.aspx?referrer=search">Kaiser Health News</a> / <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/medicare-unveils-new-form-to-enlist-seniors-in-fight-against-fraud/2012/03/06/gIQAy4LqvR_story.html">Washington Post</a> article pointed out, we’ve also redesigned the MSN to make it easier for you to help us prevent fraud and find billing errors. Did you know you could get a reward of up to $1,000 for a tip that leads to uncovering fraud? Remember, you’re our best defense against fraud, so check your MSN for services or items you didn’t get.</p>

<p>Here are some of the improvements you’ll see in your new MSN:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>         Larger text size and wider spacing to make reading easier</p></li>
<li><p>         Plain, concise language you can understand quickly</p></li>
<li><p>         A “snapshot” of</p>

<ul>
<li><p>   how much of your Part A or Part B deductible you’ve paid so far this year</p></li>
<li><p>   the providers you saw during the reporting period</p></li>
<li><p>   whether Medicare approved all your claims</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>         Brief descriptions of your medical procedures</p></li>
<li><p>         Easy-to-understand definitions for terms you might not know</p></li>
<li><p>         A checklist to help you make sure you’re getting the most from your Medicare</p></li>
<li><p>         Information on how to report fraud, preventive medical services, and important Medicare reminders</p></li>
<li><p>         Easy instructions for how to file an appeal</p></li>
</ul>


<p>You’ll start seeing these changes in early 2013 in the mailed copy of your MSN, but why wait? Visit <a href="http://www.mymedicare.gov/">MyMedicare.gov</a> and start using the newly redesigned MSN online today.</p>
