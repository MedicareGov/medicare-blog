          <p>Did you know colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States among cancers that affect both men and women?? If everyone 50 or older got screened regularly, as many as 60% of deaths from this cancer could be avoided.</p>

<p> In most cases, colorectal cancer develops from precancerous polyps (abnormal growths) in the colon or rectum. Fortunately, screening tests can find these polyps, so you can get them removed before they turn into cancer. Screening tests also can find colorectal cancer early, when treatment works best.</p>

<p> It’s National Colorectal Cancer Awareness Month – do what you can to reduce <strong>your</strong> risk for colorectal cancer. If you’re 50 or older, or have a personal or family history of colorectal issues, make sure you get screened for colorectal cancer regularly.
