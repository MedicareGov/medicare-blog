<p>The best way to stay healthy is to live a healthy lifestyle. Your loved one can live a healthy lifestyle and prevent disease by exercising, eating well, keeping a healthy weight, not smoking, and taking advantage of Medicare’s <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-and-screening-services.html">preventive services</a>.</p>

<p>Preventive services can find health problems early, when treatment works best, and can keep your loved one from getting certain diseases. The first <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/people-like-me/new-to-medicare/welcome-to-medicare-visit.html">“Welcome to Medicare” preventive visit</a> and <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly “Wellness” visit</a> are a key part of a healthy lifestyle. </p>
