          <p>When I’m getting ready to buy a new product, I will look for the clerk at the store and ask all kinds of questions.  However, when I see the doctor, I find that I don’t ask questions because I’m not sure what to ask, or I’m too embarrassed to ask. Let’s face it, many in our Hispanic community prefer to ask a coworker, friend or even a family member about health concerns or treatment advice rather than going to the doctor.</p>

<p>Well, now there’s a  <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/preguntas">Spanish Web site</a> by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) that can help us ask the right questions and can improve communication with our doctors. <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/preguntas">Conozca las preguntas</a> (Know the questions. Questions, answers and health tips for the Hispanic community) offers tips and sample questions to help you prepare for your medical appointments. You can even get biweekly tips on how to talk to your doctor. There’s also a <a href="http://4in.fo/Y9SAwg">Web site</a> available for smart phones.</p>

<p>If you ask questions and talk openly with your doctor, you can improve not only your health, but also your quality of care.  </p>
