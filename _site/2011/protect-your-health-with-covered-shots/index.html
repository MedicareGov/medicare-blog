          <p>Keeping your immune system strong is a lifelong, life-protecting job, but we’ve got you covered. Your Medicare <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/share-the-health/index.html">preventive benefits</a> include three shots:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/flu-shots.aspx"><strong>Flu Shots</strong></a>—Covered once a flu season in the fall or winter. ****</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/hepititis-b-shots.aspx"><strong>Hepatitis B Shots</strong></a><strong>—</strong>Covered for people at high or medium risk for Hepatitis B (usually a series of three shots).****</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://www.medicare.gov/navigation/manage-your-health/preventive-services/pneumococcal-shot.aspx"><strong>Pneumococcal Shot</strong></a><strong>—</strong>Covered to help prevent pneumococcal infections (like certain types of pneumonia). Most people only need this shot once in their lifetime. ****</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Getting your shots has never been easier. As we approach the fall season, you will see these shots offered in many places, such as your local pharmacy, so make sure you take advantage of them. As long as the supplier or doctor accepts assignment for giving the shot, you pay nothing.</p>
