          <p>Did you ever just get home from your doctor’s appointment and remember something you wanted to ask or share with the doctor? </p>

<li><p> Are there any alternatives or other options?</p></li>
<li><p> What are the possible complications?</p></li>
<li><p> Which hospital is best for my needs?</p></li>
<li><p> How do you spell the name of that drug?</p></li>
<li><p> Are there any side effects?</p></li>
<li><p>. Will this medicine interact with medicines that I'm already taking?</p></li>
</ol>
