          <p>Health care decisions can be tough – and they’re even harder when insurance forms, instructions and policy information aren’t written clearly.  At Medicare, it’s our job to make sure you can use our materials.</p>

<p>That’s why we’re committed to speaking and writing about the Medicare program in plain language. It’s another way we’re working to make health care information easier for you to use and understand.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:h946enr.txt.pdf"><strong>Plain Writing Act of 2010</strong></a> means that plain language isn’t just good sense - now, it’s the law.  As a Federal agency, we’re required to make sure our letters, booklets, Web pages, and any other materials are clear, concise, and easy for you to act on.</p>

<p>We’re working hard to comply with the new law. We’re training our employees, reviewing our materials, and finding new, easier ways to communicate about our programs using the <a href="http://www.plainlanguage.gov/howto/guidelines/bigdoc/TOC.cfm"><strong>Federal Plain Language Guidelines</strong></a>.</p>

<p>But we need your help—how are we doing here at Medicare?</p>

<p>We’d like you to <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/plainlanguage.aspx#survey"><strong>let us know</strong></a> if you have trouble understanding our documents or the pages on our Web site. We need to know, so we can make these things better.</p>

<p>Most of all, we want to give you the clear and accurate information you need to make good decisions for your family. <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/plainlanguage.aspx#survey"><strong>Tell us how we’re doing.</strong></a></p>
