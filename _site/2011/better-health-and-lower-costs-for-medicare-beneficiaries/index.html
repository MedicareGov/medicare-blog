          <p><em>By Don Berwick, Administrator, Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services. Cross-post from <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/medicare08042011.html">Healthcare.gov</a></em></p>

<p>It’s been a big summer for the millions of Americans who are benefitting from improved Medicare coverage thanks to the Affordable Care Act. The benefits are clear: More people are getting preventive services to keep them healthy and people with high prescription drug costs are seeing the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/news/blog/donuthole.html">donut hole coverage gap</a> starting to close – lowering the cost of drugs so that people don’t have to worry about being able to afford the care they need. Take a look at the past few months:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>June:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Through the end of June, 899,000 Americans with Medicare have benefited from the discount on brand name drugs in the Medicare Part D "donut hole" coverage gap -- an increase of over 420,000 individuals in the month of June alone.</p></li>
<li><p>These discounts have saved seniors and people with disabilities a total of $461 million, including $200 million in June alone!</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p><strong>July:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Through the end of July, 17.3 million people with traditional Medicare, or 51.5 percent, have received one of more free preventive services. </p></li>
<li><p>During the same time period, over 1 million Americans with traditional Medicare have taken advantage of Medicare’s new free Annual Wellness Visit, up from 780,000 in mid-June;</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>To learn more about these new benefits, check out the Medicare campaign, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/share-the-health/">_“Share the News, Share the Health”_</a>, to learn about the importance of prevention for people with Medicare.</p>

<p>But the good news doesn’t stop here. Over the coming years, provisions of the Affordable Care Act will help close the donut hole coverage gap completely. Here is a sense of what Medicare beneficiaries can look forward to:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>2013:</strong> You will pay less and less for your brand-name Part D prescription drugs in the donut hole.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>2020:</strong> The coverage gap will be closed, meaning there will be no more “donut hole,” and you will only pay 25% of the costs of your drugs until you reach the yearly out-of-pocket spending limit.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The chart below shows Medicare prescription drug savings over time:</p>

<p>This all amounts to even more examples of how the Affordable Care Act is providing better health care for people covered by Medicare and making a difference in the lives of millions of Americans.</p>
