          <p>For 50 years, May has been the month we celebrate older adults across the nation. You could say that Older Americans Month is coming of age. This year’s theme—“Unleash the Power of Age!”—emphasizes older Americans’ potential for energy and activism and urges them to embrace it.</p>

<p>There's no age limit on achievement—and older Americans are doing incredible things. They make a difference in their communities by continuing their careers, pursuing new business ventures, and volunteering in their retirement years.  To find ways to get involved in your community, visit <a href="http://www.Serve.gov">Serve.gov</a>.</p>

<p>Staying active, engaged, and healthy is good advice for everyone, but it's especially important for older people. <a href="http://www.aoa.gov/">The U.S Administration on Aging (AoA)</a>, supports older adults through programs and resources to encourage healthy living. In addition, the <a href="http://www.healthcare.gov/law/information-for-you/seniors.html">Affordable Care Act</a> is making certain vital preventive services, such as mammograms, diabetes screening, and an annual wellness visit, available for seniors with Medicare.  Also, check out <a href="http://go4life.nia.nih.gov/">Go4Life</a>, an exercise and physical activity campaign from the National Institute on Aging at NIH.</p>

<p>Throughout the year, and especially during <a href="http://www.olderamericansmonth.acl.gov/">Older Americans Month</a> in May, we urge all Americans to appreciate and celebrate the vitality, aspirations, and achievements of elders and their contributions to society.</p>
