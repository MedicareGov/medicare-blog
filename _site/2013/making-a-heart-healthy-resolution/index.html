<p>It’s the New Year, which means it’s time for those annual resolutions, whether it’s eating right or tackling a new skill.  But none may be more important than making the resolution to get heart healthy in 2013.</p>

<p>Did you know heart attacks and strokes are the first and fourth leading cause of death in the U.S.? The <a href="http://millionhearts.hhs.gov/">Million Hearts™ initiative</a>, launched in 2012, is aiming to prevent 1 million heart attacks and strokes by 2017. CMS and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are working with other federal agencies, communities, health systems, non-profit organizations and private-sector partners to help educate Americans on how to make a long-lasting impact against cardiovascular disease.</p>

<p>If you’re at risk for, or are already suffering from, heart disease, now’s the time to practice the “Million Hearts ABCS”:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>A</strong>spirin for people at risk</p></li>
<li><p><strong>B</strong>lood pressure control</p></li>
<li><p><strong>C</strong>holesterol management and</p></li>
<li><p><strong>S</strong>moking cessation</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Medicare can help you take control of many of the major risk factors for heart disease. People with Medicare can get <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/cardiovascular-disease-screenings.html">cardiovascular screenings</a>, <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/smoking-and-tobacco-use-cessation.html">counseling to stop smoking</a>, and blood pressure and weight checks during their <a href="http://www.medicare.gov/coverage/preventive-visit-and-yearly-wellness-exams.html">yearly wellness visit</a> with their doctor.</p>
